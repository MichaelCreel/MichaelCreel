I am a student at Los Alamos High School and a game developer.

At Los Alamos High School, I learn to develop games using Unity. I previously learned how to use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. I also learned how to write scripts for short videos and applied my previous video editing skills to these videos.

I previously attended the University of New Mexicoâ€”Los Alamos, where I completed two semesters of Industrial Robotics and Advanced Robotics (Robot Engineering). At UNMLA, I used Blender and SketchUp to create 3D models, which I printed on Ender S1 printers using Cura. I also received a certification in Industrial Robotics from UNM.

In my free time, I develop games using Unity and practice video editing using Davinci Resolve. I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at Gracie Barra Los Alamos.

After graduating high school, I plan to study computer science at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
